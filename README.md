### [Wireframes](#wireframes)
I have used [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/ie/products/xd.html) to create the wireframe for my Memory Card Game. It should have the main title at the top of the page, followed by the number of moves a user has left to find matching cards. Below this section you will find the cards, the user will flip. Between the card-section and the footer will be the result shown to the user, if they have won or lost the game.

This is my inital approach towards my project, which might change during the process of it.
